```

The data consisted of samples from `r nq` 2x2m quadrats.
After data processing there were `r g1 |> activate(nodes) |> select(name) |> as_tibble() |> summarise(count = n())` species forming `r g1 |> activate(edges) |> as_tibble() |> summarise(count = n())` significantly non-independent dyads, representing both associative and disassociative links. The distribution of the log(odds ratio) is shown in the figure; values less than zero are disassociative, values greater than zero are associative. There were `r g1 %>% activate(edges) %>% as_tibble() |> select(lor) |> filter(lor>0) |> count()` associative links and `r g1 %>% activate(edges) %>% as_tibble() |> select(lor) |> filter(lor<=0) |> count()` disassociative links.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
edges <- g1 %>% activate(edges) %>% as_tibble()
plt1 <- ggplot(edges, aes(lor))  +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.25, colour = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, colour = "red") +
  xlim(-5, 10) +
  ylim(0.0, 0.4) +
  labs(title ="", x = "log(odds ratio)")

The dyads are the observed data. The SBM builds a representation of the uncertain nature of the data by assigning probabilities to the links. The probabilities form blocks such that the probability of links between dyads within a block differs from the probability of links between dyads ending in different blocks.  In our case, there are seven blocks. The model is summed up by an 7x7 matrix. The values on the leading diagonal are the probabilities of finding links within a block, the off-diagonal values are the probabilities of finding links between the corresponding blocks. The matrix is shown in Table 1. The in-block probabilities in the leading diagonal are shown in bold face. Red text indicates the maximum probability for each row (column).

Clusters are identified when the in_block probabilities on the leading diagonal are greater than the out-block probabilities [@SBMreview]. Here only groups one and three are inclusive clusters. The remaining blocks are exclusions.
